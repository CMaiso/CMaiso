## Hey, I'm Camille 👋
I'm a Front-end engineer with 3+ years of experience building website projects with React/Redux, Vue.js/Nuxt and Node.js. I'm a proactive learner and I like challenging myself by learning and teaching new things. I also do enjoy working on the parts that people see and interact with, like everything related to UI and UX design.

For me, development should be a teamwork in an emphatic and supportive environment.
